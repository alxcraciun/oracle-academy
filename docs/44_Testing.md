# Testing

- It is important to test only one thing at a time.
- This is commonly reffered to as unit testing.

<br>

**Regarding a database you can test:**

- Column data types
- Proper data contraints
- Storage capacity of a column

<br>

> For large databases, don't check each column and each constraint.<br>
> Perform a random spread of tests, that checks some columns and some constraints. 

<br>

**Remember to track you testing process:**

1. Date
2. Test number
3. Test description
4. Input 
5. Expected Output
6. Result / Discrepancy
7. Action required
